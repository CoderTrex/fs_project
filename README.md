## Project Structure

### 1. `check_project`
This folder contains files that provide quantitative information about the project's code, such as code metrics. It helps quickly understand the scale and nature of the project.

### 2. `server`
The `server` folder contains the server-side code. It must be executed before starting the client. Ensure that all pip libraries listed in the file are installed.

### 3. `project`
The `project` folder contains the client-side code. The development environment for this program is Windows, specifically using Visual Studio Code. All source files related to the client are located here.

### 4. `webtoonDB`
The `webtoonDB` folder contains essential data required by the server to function. The server uses this data to communicate with the client. The project will not work without configuring the database in this folder correctly.
